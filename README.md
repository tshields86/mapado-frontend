## Mapado NYC

Mapado is a task manager that focuses on visualizing upcoming users events and task rather then displaying them through a calendar or list. It is a work in progress... but on top of providing the user with capabilities of adding, editing, deleting tasks, and populating a map with all the to-dos, Mapado aims to create a platform where users can filter their tasks and view them by day, week, month, and location proximity. In hopes of increasing productivity while decreasing travel time, users will visualize their upcoming task and may even re-schedule them in a way that can cut travel and preparation time. Stay tuned, more features coming soon...

Built in React and Express with a Mongo database.

Currently using Mapbox API and Google geolocation API.
